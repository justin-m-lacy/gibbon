This is a simple pixi.js Game Engine Framework to help make games quickly with pixi.js

Right now it's a very bare-bones framework, mostly because I just wanted to wrap pixi graphic elements with enough capabilities to get something running.

I found phasar and a lot of the other frameworks had a lot of overhead for doing really simple things, and were difficult to get to the real underpinnings of what was going on.

A sample game I made in with the framework can be found at https://github.com/lerpinglemur/snowflakes

I might prototype a few more games in the future, and clean up the framework as I go along.
